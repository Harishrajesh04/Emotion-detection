# Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning  

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to detect emotions from textual or audio inputs. The goal is to classify emotions accurately and provide insights into human sentiment, which can be applied in various domains like customer feedback analysis, mental health monitoring, and chatbot development.  

### Objectives  
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**  
   - Acquire and preprocess datasets containing labeled emotion data (text or audio).  
   - Handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare features for modeling.  

2. **Model Development:**  
   - Build and train machine learning models for emotion classification.  
   - Evaluate models for optimal performance.  

3. **Visualization and Insights:**  
   - Provide graphical representations of emotion distributions and model predictions.  

4. **Interactive Application:**  
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time emotion detection using Streamlit.  

### Features  
- Classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more.  
- Supports text or audio input for emotion analysis.  
- Provides visual insights into emotion trends.  

### Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLTK/Spacy for text, Librosa for audio  
- **GUI Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

This repository offers a comprehensive solution for understanding and analyzing emotions using machine learning.
